## Hi there 👋
***
I'm a software engineer based out of Charlotte, NC with experience in Data Engineering, Cloud Infrastructure, and Mobile Development (especially SwiftUI).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a native iOS app that allows user's to track their drinking habits and estimates blood alcohol content in real time.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Certification as well as the FINRA SIE Exam.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was recognized as a winner of Apple's 2024 Swift Student Challenge in which I made a Swift app that generated a Color Palette from any image.
